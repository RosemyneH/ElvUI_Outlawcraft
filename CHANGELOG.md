## [7.44](https://github.com/RosemyneH/ElvUI_Outlawcraft/releases/tag/v7.44) (2026-10-05)

### Features

* OutlawCraft add-on skin: every OutlawCraft window, button, slot and scroll bar in ElvUI media, fonts and colours
* Datatexts for OutlawCraft: Hunger, Thirst, Hunger Regen, Food & Water (with regeneration tooltip) and Exposure (body heat / wetness; right-click or `/ec` → DataTexts → "Hide Comfortable / Dry" leaves out the normal stages)
* A Crafting tab under the spellbook's school tabs opens the Blueprints crafting window
* ElvUI's loot frame stands down while the OutlawCraft loot window is enabled
* ElvUI tooltips take over the tooltip look from OutlawCraft when the ElvUI tooltip module is on

### Changes

* Project Astral features (micro button, GM icon, reagent bank button) require the ProjectAstral add-on
* Update and support links point to ElvUI_Outlawcraft
